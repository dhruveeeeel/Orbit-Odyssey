    <h2>Formation</h2>
    <p>A 2012 artistic impression of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk from which Earth and other Solar System bodies were formed.</p>
    <p>The oldest material in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002 −0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.</p>
    <p>By 4.54±0.04 Ga, the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System evolved with the Sun.</p>
    <p>The nebular theory suggests that planets formed from a spinning, flattened circumstellar disk within a solar nebula.</p>
    <p>Planetesimals formed by accretion, and the primordial Earth likely took 70 to 100 million years to form.</p>
    <p>The Moon's formation is hypothesized to be the result of a collision with a Mars-sized object named Theia.</p>
    <p>Between 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment altered the Moon's and Earth's surfaces.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>After Formation</h2>
    <p>Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed through volcanic activity and outgassing.</p>
    <p>Water vapor condensed into oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.</p>
    <p>Earth's magnetic field, established by 3.5 Ga, prevented atmospheric loss to solar wind.</p>
    <p>The first solid crust formed as the molten outer layer cooled. Continental crust evolved through plate tectonics.</p>
    <p>Supercontinents like Rodinia, Pannotia, and Pangaea formed and broke apart over millions of years.</p>
    <p>The most recent ice ages began about 40 Ma, intensifying during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma.</p>
    <p>Glaciation cycles repeated approximately every 21,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Origin of Life and Evolution</h2>
    <p>Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules around four billion years ago.</p>
    <p>The last common ancestor of all current life forms emerged half a billion years later.</p>
    <p>Photosynthesis evolved, leading to the accumulation of molecular oxygen and the development of eukaryotes.</p>
    <p>Life colonized Earth's surface, with evidence of microbial fossils dating back 3.45 billion years.</p>
    <p>The Neoproterozoic era (1000 to 539 Ma) may have experienced a "Snowball Earth" covered in ice.</p>
    <p>After the Cambrian explosion (535 Ma), five major mass extinctions occurred, including the one 66 Ma triggered by an asteroid impact.</p>
    <p>Mammalian life diversified over the past 66 million years, leading to the evolution of humans.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>Earth's long-term future is tied to the Sun's evolution.</p>
    <p>Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase, affecting the carbon cycle and potentially leading to oxygen loss.</p>
    <p>Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C in 1.5 billion years, leading to ocean water evaporation.</p>
    <p>The Sun will evolve into a red giant in about 5 billion years, potentially impacting Earth's orbit.</p>
    <p>Earth's fate, whether it moves to a distant orbit or vaporizes, depends on tidal effects during the Sun's expansion.</p>
